# 🛠️ Mocksmith

> Forge API responses. No backend. No mercy.

**Mocksmith** is a browser-first API mocking tool that intercepts, forges, and rewrites API responses directly in your browser — no proxy, no backend, no waiting.

It supports both **RESTful APIs** and **GraphQL**, designed to unblock frontend development with minimal setup and maximum control.
